# Module 1: ROS2 Fundamentals

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This module provides a comprehensive introduction to Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), which forms the foundation for developing intelligent robotic systems.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn the core concepts of ROS2, the middleware that enables communication between different components of a robotic system. We'll cover everything from basic node architecture to complex robot description formats, preparing you for advanced robotics development.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Create and configure ROS2 nodes with proper communication patterns
- Implement publish/subscribe and service/client communication
- Model robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Configure complex robotic systems using launch files and parameters

## Module Structure

This module is organized into five comprehensive chapters:

### Chapter 1.1: Introduction to Physical AI
Explore the concept of Physical AI and embodied intelligence, understanding how intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's body, sensors, actuators, and environment. Learn about key components of Physical AI systems and their applications.

### Chapter 1.2: ROS2 Architecture & Nodes
Dive deep into ROS2 architecture, learning how to create nodes, implement communication patterns, and manage parameters. Understand the publish/subscribe model and service/client interactions with practical examples.

### Chapter 1.3: Topics & Services
Master the publish/subscribe communication pattern for streaming data and the request/reply pattern for synchronous operations. Learn advanced features like Quality of Service (QoS) settings and best practices for real-world applications.

### Chapter 1.4: URDF for Humanoids
Learn to model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format), including joints, links, and physical properties. Understand Xacro macros for complex robot descriptions and Gazebo integration.

### Chapter 1.5: Launch Files & Parameters
Discover how to orchestrate complex robotic systems using launch files, configure parameters through YAML files, and manage system startup with conditional execution.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic programming experience in Python
