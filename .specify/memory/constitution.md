# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Excellence
All examples MUST be runnable with ROS2/Gazebo/Isaac on Ubuntu 22.04, ensuring practical and hands-on learning for users.

### II. Production Code Standards
All code MUST adhere to PEP8 guidelines, include comprehensive type hints, and be thoroughly tested in Docker containers to maintain high quality and reliability.

### III. Documentation with Docusaurus and GitHub Pages
The textbook MUST be published using Docusaurus 3.9 and deployed to GitHub Pages via CI/CD pipeline for accessible and version-controlled documentation.

### IV. RAG Chatbot Integration
A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot MUST be integrated using FastAPI, powered by Cohere and Qdrant, with a target accuracy of >90%.

### V. Enhanced Authentication and Onboarding
The authentication signup process MUST include background questions to better understand user needs and tailor their experience.

### VI. Personalized Chapter Content
Chapters MUST offer personalization based on the user's expertise level, providing a customized learning path.

### VII. Urdu Translation Support
The entire textbook content MUST support Urdu translation to cater to a broader audience.

## Acceptance Criteria

### I. Code Functionality
All provided code examples MUST run successfully on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 installation without errors.

### II. Web Performance
The Docusaurus website MUST achieve a Lighthouse performance score of >95.

### III. Chatbot Accuracy
The integrated RAG chatbot MUST demonstrate >90% accuracy in its responses.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other project practices. Amendments require thorough documentation, explicit approval from stakeholders, and a clear migration plan for any significant changes. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity introduced into the project MUST be justified clearly against these principles.
